Hello!

This is some code to help memorize consonants for ling 1 midterm. You run it like

./cons.py manner   OR   ./cons.py place

and then you answer the questions. You can type in 'status' anytime in order to view
your progress. Likewise for any given consonant, you can type 'example' to get an 
example word to understand the pronounciation.
